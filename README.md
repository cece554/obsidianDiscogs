Create a music database in Obsidian with the [QuickAdd Plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) and the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers).

This is largely based off the [Movie Database](https://minimal.guide/Guides/Create+a+movie+database) 
Script found in the Minimal documentation; the setup for this script is similar.

## Setup
The most important part is obtaining a [Discogs Key and Secret](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers). To do this, you will need to create an application (note that we wonâ€™t be using a token).

- Add the`Discogs.js` script to your vault. If you use the Movie script you can drop this in the same folder.
- Create a template. You can use or modify my `Music Template.md` if you do desire.
- Create a macro in QuickAdd. For this, I recommend you follow the [Movie Database documentation](https://minimal.guide/Guides/Create+a+movie+database), that guide is far more comprehensive than I could write.
